This is a simple RPG game written in Python, to train my OOP skills

# Techniques and skills

I used following methonds in my game till now:

  - modules - where i hold my classes
  - main - the file where the sxecution takes place
  - magic methods overloading - on hero class to print the current state
  - inharitance - to inherit the method for hunger
  - decorator - used static method instead of function to maintain order

I used following standard library and third party libraries:
